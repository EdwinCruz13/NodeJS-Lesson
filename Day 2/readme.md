# NodeJS-Lesson - Your First Server with HTTP Module

<details open="">
  <summary><h2>âœ¨HTTP Status Codes</h2></summary>
    <p dir="auto">
        To create a webserver in nodejs, it is necessary to know about http status code, more detail you can find it in the next website <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">ðŸ”— HERE!!!</a>
        <br>
        these status codes could be categorized as:
        <br>
              * 1xx Informational response â€“ the request was received, continuing process.
        <br>
              * 2xx Successful â€“             the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
        <br>
              * 3xx Redirection â€“            further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.
        <br>
              * 4xx Client error â€“           the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
        <br>
              * 5xx Server error â€“           the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
    </p>
    <p>
        * Node provide us with the inbuilt http module which we can use to create the server. Get the access to the module by using 'require'.
        <br>
        * To develop this example we need to define two variable: host = 127.0.0.1 and port = 3000,

  <summary><h2>ðŸ’ª Example with HTTP Module</h2></summary>
  <p dir="auto">
    
- [x] It is time to create a new file, you can name it as "2-Server.js".
- [x] Add the next code:
```
var http = require('http');
```
- [x] The variable will help to instance the module HTTP, and then create two variable named host and port
```
var host = '127.0.0.1'; //localhost
var port = 3000; // default port
```
- [x] Create a server using the createServer() method. createServer() method takes a callback function as arguments. This callback is executed each time a request is received. The two arguments of createServer() method are:
- request : which contains all the information related to client's request such as URL, custom headers , client info , etc.
- response : which is used to return the data back to the client.
- [x] Inside the arrow function, write the next method throuht response arguments.
- response.writeHead: it is an inbuilt method which is used to send the status code and the MIME type. (Content-Type)
- response.end(): it is an inbuilt function which is used to tell the server that the request has been fulfilled.Along with that we can also send one response using this.
```
var server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    //Sends a response header to the request. 
    //The status code is a 3-digit HTTP status code, like 200. The last argument, headers, are the response headers
    response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type" : "text/plain"})
    response.end('Server Working Success');
});
```
- [x] Then we have to use the method named 'listen' thay would help to run the server accordint the host and port:
```
server.listen(port, host, (error) => {
    if(error)   
        return console.error(`Error has occured: ${error}`);

    console.log(`Server is listening on ${host}:${port}`);
});
```

```
//Node provide us with a inbuilt http module which we can use to create the server
var http = require('http');

//Define a host and port
var host = '127.0.0.1'; //localhost
var port = 3000; // default port

//create an object type http
var server = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    //Sends a response header to the request. 
    //The status code is a 3-digit HTTP status code, like 404. The last argument, headers, are the response headers
    response.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type" : "text/plain"})
    response.end('Server Working Success');
});

//execute the server using the 'listen method'
server.listen(port, host, (error) => {
    if(error)   
        return console.error(`Error has occured: ${error}`);

    console.log(`Server is listening on ${host}:${port}`);
});
```
