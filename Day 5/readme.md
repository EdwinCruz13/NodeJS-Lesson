# NodeJS-Lesson - Non-Blocking and Blocking code

<details close="">
  <summary><h2>✨Overview</h2></summary>
    <p dir="auto">
        One of the features which distinguishes Node.js is that it uses non-blocking code. Node is assumed to prevent blocking code by using a single-threaded event loop, a good idea in order to increase the performents in your application but, but, but.... 😫 😫 😫
        <br>
        🧐 Consider some scenarios in your application what it is necessary wait for any result of section of code as:
        <br>

- [x] Consume any REST API and waiting for results.
        <br>
- [x] Reading or Writing some data to a DB.
        <br>
- [x] Reading or Writing data from a file on FileSystem.
        <br>
    </p>

<a href="#"> **So, in this page, we will discuss the pro and cons using the non-blocking code and when we have to execute the application with blocking Code.**</a>
    <br>  
 **Firstly, define some concepts:**
        <br>
- Non-blocking Code: The function whose execution is not affected by other functions/tasks or in simple terms which are asynchronous in nature comes under non-blocking code.
        <br>
- Blocking Code : The function whose execution is affected by other functions/tasks or in simple terms which are synchronous in nature comes under blocking code.

  <summary><h2>🚧 Example of Blocking Code</h2></summary>
    <p dir="auto">
        In this example, we are going to create a new file named "NonBlocking.js", it can be found <a href="https://github.com/EdwinCruz13/NodeJS-Lesson/blob/main/Day%205/NonBlocking.js">🔗 HERE!!!</a>. The porpurse of this file is read a .txt file from a path (resource) using a 'synchronous reading', in order to measure the time of execution, lets define variable for a chronometer app.
    </p>
    <p dir="auto">

- [x] Capture the time of begining of the application using all the functions from "Date()" library:
```
var currentDate = new Date();
var timeStart = currentDate.getTime();
```
- [x] Read a file synchronously from the resource path:
###### the text.txt can be found <a href="https://github.com/EdwinCruz13/NodeJS-Lesson/blob/main/Day%205/resources/text.txt">👓 Here</a>. If you would rather create your own file it's ok, you just have to add some random text.
```
var file = "resources/text.txt";
var content = fs.readFileSync(file);
```
- [x] Then, caputre the time of ending of the application using Date() function again into other variables:
```
var lastDate = new Date();
var timeEnd = lastDate.getTime();
```
- [x] Using a 'console.log' show the result after of execution:
```
var elapsedTime = timeEnd-timeStart;
console.log("\nStart of execution: " + timeStart + " ms");
console.log("End of execution: " + timeEnd + " ms");
console.log("Time of execution: " + elapsedTime + " ms");
```
