        One of the features which distinguishes Node.js is that it uses non-blocking code. Node is assumed to prevent blocking code by using a single-threaded event loop, but, but, but.... 😫 😫 😫
        <br>
        🧐 Consider some scenarios in your application that it is necessary wait for any result of section of code as:
        <br>

- [x] Consume any REST API and waiting for results.
        <br>
- [x] Reading or Writing some data to a DB.
        <br>
- [x] Reading or Writing data from a file on FileSystem.
        <br>
- [x] So, in this page, we will discuss the pro and cons using the non-blocking code.

        Firstly, define some concepts:
    <br>
        * Non-blocking Code: The function whose execution is not affected by other functions/tasks or in simple terms which are asynchronous in nature comes under non-blocking code.

        * Blocking Code : The function whose execution is affected by other functions/tasks or in simple terms which are synchronous in nature comes under blocking code.
