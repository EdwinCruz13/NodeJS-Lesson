        In the class <a href="https://github.com/EdwinCruz13/NodeJS-Lesson/tree/main/Day%202">Day 2 - Node Package Manager.<a/> we learnt about the node package manager and ways to install, update and delete any package to our application using the ***keyword*** "require", that is how we use a module from another library, that is known as modularization.
        <br>
        üßê Now, it's time to create our own modules and to import a main file in order to modularize the application.

  <summary><h2>üö¢ Exporting a file</h2></summary>
  
  **The module.exports is a special object which is included in every JavaScript file in the Node.js application by default. The module is a variable that represents the current module, and exports is an object that will be exposed as a module. So, whatever you assign to module.exports will be exposed as a module.**

- [x] Create a file named "module.exports.js" and add the next sentence:
```
module.exports = 'Hello world';
```
- [x] Now, create a new file named "main.js" and use the keyword import in orden to use the funcionality from "module.exports.js". PD: do not forget the "./"
```
//import from module.exports.js
var msg = require('./module.exports.js');
//print the result
console.log(msg)
```

 * - **The exports is an object. So, you can attach properties or methods to it. The following example exposes an object with a string property in exports.js file.**
