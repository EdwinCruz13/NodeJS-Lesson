        Routing refers to how an application‚Äôs endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing. Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched. Route definition takes the following structure:
  <br>
        
  ```
  app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
  ```
  <br>
        
  - **App** is an instance of express.
  - **METHOD** is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
  - **PATH** is a path on the server.
  - **HANDLER** is the function executed when the route is matched.

  <summary><h2>üí¨ Request methods</h2></summary>
  <p dir="auto">
        HTTP Methods or HTTP VERBS defines methods to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server.

    **Below is a table summarizing recommended return values of the primary HTTP methods in combination with the resource URIs:**
    <figure class="table">
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><p style="text-align:center">HTTP Verb</p></td>
            <td><p style="text-align:center">CRUD</p></td>
            <td><p style="text-align:center">Description</p></td>
            <td><p style="text-align:center">Example</p></td>
            <td><p style="text-align:center">Exit</p></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>POST</td>
            <td>Create</td>
            <td>The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. 
                In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc</td>
            <td>POST http://www.example.com/customers</td>
            <td>404 (Not Found), 409 (Conflict) if resource already exists</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>Read</td>
            <td>The HTTP GET method is used to **read** or retrieve a representation of a resource.
                GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK)</td>
            <td>GET http://www.example.com/customers/12345</td>
            <td>200 (OK), single customer. 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PUT</td>
            <td>Update/Replace</td>
            <td>PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with 
                the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource.</td>
            <td>PUT http://www.example.com/customers/12345</td>
            <td>200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>PATCH</td>
            <td>Update/Modify</td>
            <td>PATCH is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource</td>
            <td>PATCH http://www.example.com/customers/12345</td>
            <td>200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid</td>
          </tr>
           <tr>
            <td>DELETE</td>
            <td>Delete</td>
            <td>DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to **delete** a resource identified by a URI.</td>
            <td>DELETE http://www.example.com/customers/12345</td>
            <td>200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid</td>
          </tr>

<summary><h2>üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Run your Express Server</h2></summary>
  <p dir="auto">

- [x] Now open the index.js file that was created before.
- [x] It is time to import express using the next command.
```
const express = require('express');
```
- [x] Then, instance express into a object.
```
const app = express();
```
- [x] Finally, execute the application as webserver like this way:
```
app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Server on port 3000`)
})
```

</br></br>

- [x] Open your browser and check your webserver:
</br></br>

</br></br>

- [x] <h3>In your browser you will see a kind of error, It is not!!!</h3>, the reason is we did not define any "route" and a "content-type" that the browser could understand, before the execution command, add the next command after the instancing of express and execute the app again.
```
//define a main route
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello world")
})
```
